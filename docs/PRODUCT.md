# DevTask

### Parallel AI task sessions for developers

DevTask lets engineers run multiple independent AI-assisted coding tasks in parallel, without losing control or context.

Instead of working with one AI thread at a time, developers can create isolated task sessions that run concurrently in fresh environments. Each session has its own branch, its own discussion thread, and its own lifecycle.

## The Problem

AI coding tools today are single-threaded experiences. You work on one task, wait, switch context, re-explain, repeat.

Developers constantly juggle small to medium tasks:

- Add tests to a module
- Refactor a subsystem
- Upgrade dependencies
- Implement a well-scoped feature
- Fix lint or type errors

These tasks are often independent, but current tools force sequential execution and constant babysitting.

## The Solution

DevTask introduces structured, parallel AI sessions.

Each task:

- Runs in an isolated environment
- Has a structured brief and plan
- Follows a deterministic execution loop
- Validates itself using tests or commands
- Creates its own branch and pull request

Developers can:

- Start multiple tasks in parallel
- Switch between sessions instantly
- Answer clarification questions in batches
- Review summaries instead of raw logs
- Merge results independently

It’s not fire-and-forget automation. It’s organized, scalable AI collaboration.

## How It Works

1. Create a task with a structured brief.
2. DevTask provisions an isolated environment.
3. The AI generates a plan and executes it.
4. The system runs validation commands and iterates until success or timeout.
5. A pull request is created with a concise summary.
6. Developers review and merge.

Sessions can pause when blocked and resume later. You stay in control, but you’re no longer stuck in a single AI thread.

## Why It’s Different

- Built for parallelism, not chat.
- Designed for independent, production-ready tasks.
- Structured execution reduces babysitting.
- Clear lifecycle: brief → plan → execute → validate → PR.
- Unified view of all active AI sessions.

## Vision

Turn AI coding from a single-threaded assistant into a multitasking development engine.

Developers should be able to offload independent work, manage multiple streams of progress, and move faster without cognitive overload.

DevTask helps engineers achieve more by organizing AI work the way modern development actually happens: in parallel.
